## About ELTsim
A test run & use case of [EvoELT](https://github.com/kennyokeke/EvoELT). 

ELTsim is a Sims-inspired tool designed to optimize character activities through AI-powered insights and data-driven recommendations. By integrating with EvoELT, ELTsim tracks activity schedules, metrics, and patterns over time to reveal how actions affect key character traits like happiness, energy, and relationships. It provides real-time analysis to help players make informed decisions and maximize outcomes for their virtual characters.
